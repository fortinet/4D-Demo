# SD-WAN demonstration configurations (4-D)

4-D Demo configurations are a collection of configurations which complement the preceeding 3 Ds: Define, Design, and Deploy. These configrations are some samples of SD-WAN implementations for:

- Branches with no central hub or Datacenter
- Single hub/DC and branches
- Dual hub/DC and branches

For further details on SD-WAN features and deployment methods, such as using FortiManager to manage your configuration and deployment, please see the [SD-WAN section](https://docs.fortinet.com/sdwan/7.0) of our document library.

# Overview

*Standalone SD-WAN* contains configuration for a branch with no central hub which. This configuration does not integrate with any other files in this repository.

*Single Hub* and *Dual Hub* both have a base configuration for the Hub(s) and Branches. These config files listed below are the base configuration which more advanced features (extensions) may be added to.

## Single Hub:
- single_hub_HUB1_SD-WAN_Overlay.txt
- single_hub_Branch1_SD-WAN_Overlay.txt
- single_hub_Branch2_SD-WAN_Overlay.txt

## Dual Hub:
- dual_hub_HUB1_SD-WAN_Overlay.txt
- dual_hub_HUB2_SD-WAN_Overlay.txt
- dual_hub_Branch1_SD-WAN_and_Overlay.txt
- dual_hub_Branch2_SD-WAN_and_Overlay.txt

The extensions are designed to be added if necessary and may be combined with each other. Each addon will involve a configuration file for both the hub(s) and branches. All configuration files for a given extension must be added for the feature to work.

Changes made to the base configuration may affect an extension's ability to be integrated. Changes to things such as policy ID numbers, SD-WAN rule numbers, BGP peer names, will need to be reflected in the extension configuration files as well.

# How to
Begin by selecting a base topology; standalone, single or dual hub.

Review the topology's assumptions in the readme file and make the necessary changes to the configuration to match your deployment.

Install the updated base configuration file(s) of that topology to your branch and if applicable, your hub(s).

For single and dual hub topologies, you may add additional extensions by reviewing the extension readme, making the necessary changes based off the listed assumptions and installing the updated configuration.

# Disclaimers

These configurations are for SD-WAN and related aspects, such as policies, address objects, BGP, IPsec. This configuration alone does not provide sufficient security for a given location. Please review [FortiGate Best Practices](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.0/best-practices/587898/getting-started) and [FortiGate Admin Guide](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.5/administration-guide/954635/getting-started) to compliment this deployment.

An IP address scheme for HUB LAN, Branch LAN and IPSec is chosen which reflects the principles discussed in the complementing 4D documents; design and define. Careful consideration should be taken when changing the scheme.

The WAN IP addresses are not discussed out side of the IPsec configuration on the branches (remote gateway).

Underlay routing is assumed to be present. No consideration is given for hub or branches internet reachability. It is assumed that any given FortiGate has full internet connectivity and public IP addresses. Furthermore, the two WAN links are assumed to be functioning in an equal cost multi path configuration where both gateways are present in the routing table.
