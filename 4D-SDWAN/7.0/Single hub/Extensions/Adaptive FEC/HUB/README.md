# SD-WAN single hub adaptive forward error correction - HUB

This configuration is to enable adaptive FEC on the hub. Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used to control and correct errors in data transmission by sending redundant data across the VPN in anticipation of dropped packets occurring during transit. The mechanism sends out x number of redundant packets for every y number of base packets.

FEC is enabled in IPsec phase 1 settings of each overlay.

FED is enabled on desired firewall policies.

For more details on adaptive FEC, please see the [Adaptive Forward Error Correction](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.5/administration-guide/169010/adaptive-forward-error-correction) chapter of the FortiGate admin guide.
