# SD-WAN single hub BGP route steering - HUB

This configuration is to enable BGP route steering on the hub. As SD-WAN intelligence affects which WAN interface is used, BGP can be leveraged to communicate these decisions to it's neighbors.

The HUB has a routemap on incoming  neighbors that matches the Branch community # with a specified route-tag. 
-Community 1 or 2 (SLA good) are mapped to route-tag 1 & 2 respectively. 
Community 5 (out of SLA) is mapped to a route-tag 5. 

SD-WAN rules on the HUB are configured to map route-tag 1 with VPN 1 and route-tag 2 with VPN 2. Under normal conditions, Branch traffic will flow through these interfaces (VPN1 first, VPN2 second based on order). 

Upon SLA failure, the incoming community 5 does not match a given rule and goes to the default routing table. 

For more details on controlling traffic with BGP route steering, please see the [controlling traffic with BGP route mapping](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.5/administration-guide/256748/controlling-traffic-with-bgp-route-mapping-and-service-rules) chapter of the FortiGate admin guide. 

# Assumptions

The following settings are specific to the demo and should be changed to fit your environment as necessary.

1) The branches will send bgp community strings of 65000:1, 65000:2, and 65000:5.
